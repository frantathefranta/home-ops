* Introduction
This is my repo detailing home-ops based around Kubernetes (ran on Talos Linux).
It's based on the [[https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template][cluster-template]] generously created and maintained by [[https://github.com/onedr0p][onedr0p]]. Slight modifications were made by me (because I don't know better).
