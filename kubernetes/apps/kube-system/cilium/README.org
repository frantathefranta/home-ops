#+title: Setting up BGP outside the cluster
* Subnet setup
** IPv6
On my residential ISP connection I only get a /60. I've dedicated a /64 subnet to kubernetes, of which I've given /96 to this cluster's Pod subnet. It needs to be split using a bigger than /96 mask since the by default it gives a /64 to each node. I've used a /112 mask, which allows 2^16 nodes to have 2^16 pods.
* Arista
I use an Arista DCS-7050SX-64 L3 switch for routing in my homelab. The BGP setup looks like this:
#+begin_src sh :noeval
router bgp 65033 # Sets up the local AS to be 65033
router-id 10.33.0.1 # Naming the router

# For automatic finding of peers, use the bgp listen command
bgp listen range 10.33.35.0/27 peer-group talos-maxi remote-as 65069

# Alternatively you can still specify peers manually
neighbor 10.33.35.1 remote-as 65069 # Adding the talos nodes as neighbors in the Cilium AS (65069). Repeat this for all the nodes
#+end_src
If IPv6 is needed, the additional config looks like this:
#+begin_src sh :noeval
bgp listen range <prefix>::/64 peer-group talos-maxi remote-as 65069

# Alternatively you can still specify peers manually
neighbor fd30:6ff9:e40f:3333::351 remote-as 65069 # Adding a neighbor (talos node) with its IPv6 address
address-family ipv6 # BGP on Aristas doesn't use IPv6 out-of-the-box, you'll need to go into a subsetting, then activate a neighbor
neighbor fd30:6ff9:e40f:3333::351 activate

write mem # Don't forget
#+end_src
Check if you are done (your peers should say ~Estab~ in the state column, might take a few minutes):
#+begin_src sh :noeval
arista01(config-router-bgp-af)#sh ipv6 bgp sum

You can also check Cilium with its CLI utility:
