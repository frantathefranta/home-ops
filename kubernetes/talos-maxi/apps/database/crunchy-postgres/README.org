#+title: Postgres Setup
* Initial setup
*IMPORTANT:* The very first time you add the Crunchy Postgres config to your cluster, the ~spec.dataSource~  in ~postgrescluster.yaml~ has to be uncommented. Otherwise you'll get a loop of pgbackrest-restore pods that try to connect to an s3 repo to get data to restore but they won't find anything.

Even if you comment it out later, it doesn't seem to fix the bootstrap process. The solution that worked for me was reverting the initial commit for adding the Postgres config, waiting until all of the resources got deleted, then pushed the config again.
* User Management
The users defined in ~postgrescluster.yaml~ key ~spec.users~ are the ones that get created. Passwords will be auto-generated if declared like this:
#+begin_src yaml :noeval
  users:
    # Superuser
    - name: "postgres"
      databases: ["postgres"]
      options: "SUPERUSER"
      password:
        type: AlphaNumeric
#+end_src

They'll be in a *ClusterSecretStore* called ~crunchy-pgo-secrets~ and formated as ~<clusterName>-pguser-<userName>~ (this is how it is in my deployment that I've copied from the #k8s-at-home folks).
You can then use these secrets with *ExternalSecret* CRDs, just like this:
#+begin_src yaml :noeval
---
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://lds-schemas.pages.dev/external-secrets.io/externalsecret_v1beta1.json
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1

  target:
    name: gatus-secret
    creationPolicy: Merge
    deletionPolicy: Retain
    template:
      type: Opaque
      data:
        POSTGRES_URI: '{{ index . "pgbouncer-uri" }}'

      key: postgres-pguser-gatus
#+end_src

** Troubleshooting
If you are getting this error in a pod that you set up a user for in crunchy PG:
#+begin_src sh :noeval
ERROR:  permission denied for schema public
#+end_src
that means your user-init controller did not set up correctly for the new user. Restarting the pod with the user-init controller should fix this.
