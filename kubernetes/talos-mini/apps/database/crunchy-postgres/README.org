#+title: Postgres Setup
* Initial setup
The very first time you add the Crunchy Postgres config to your cluster, the ~spec.dataSource~ has to be uncommented.
* User Management
The users defined in ~postgrescluster.yaml~ key ~spec.users~ are the ones that get created. Passwords will be auto-generated if declared like this:
#+begin_src yaml :noeval
  users:
    # Superuser
    - name: "postgres"
      databases: ["postgres"]
      options: "SUPERUSER"
      password:
        type: AlphaNumeric
#+end_src

They'll be in a format ~<clusterName>-pguser-<userName>~
