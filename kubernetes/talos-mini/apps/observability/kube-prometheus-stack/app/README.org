** Alert manager
*** Dead Man Snitch/Switch
Some people use uptimerobot.com, but I'm too cheap so I host [[https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma][uptime-kuma]] in the cloud. To get a similar functionality, I utilize [[https://github.com/natrontech/alertmanager-uptime-kuma-push][natrontech/alertmanager-uptime-kuma-push]].
****  uptime-kuma monitor settings
1. *Monitor type*: Push
2. *Heartbeat interval*: 60 seconds
3. *Retries*: 0
4. *Heartbeat retry interval*: 60 seconds
5. *Resend notification*: 0
**** alert-manager routes
The defaults that the middleware suggests looks like this:
#+begin_src yaml :noeval
route:
    routes:
        - receiver: Dead Mans Snitch Uptime Kuma
          matchers:
            - alertname =~ "InfoInhibitor|Watchdog"
          group_wait: 0s
          group_interval: 50s
          repeat_interval: 1m
#+end_src
This *did not* work for me, the alert manager only send the ~POST~ request every 2.5 minutes. I had to change the ~group_interval~ to 15s and the ~repeat_interval~ to 30s. It now pushes the ~POST~ request every 30 seconds and works as intended.
