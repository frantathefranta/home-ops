#+title: Proxmox Certs
* Quirks
- Proxmox only accepts the *leaf* certificate, not the whole certificate chain with the intermediate cert. That's why this (only getting the first certificate in the secret) is necessary:
  #+begin_src terraform
locals {
  leaf_certificate = regexall("-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----[\\s\\S]*?-----END CERTIFICATE-----", local.base64decoded_cert)
}

resource "proxmox_virtual_environment_certificate" "thorium" {
  certificate       = "${local.leaf_certificate[0]}\n"
}
  #+end_src
- Proxmox also stores its certificates with a new-line, which seems to not be present when secrets are imported from Akeyless
- ~cert-manager~ generates the secret like this:
  #+begin_src yaml
stringData:
  tls.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    (leaf)
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    (intermediate)
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  #+end_src
